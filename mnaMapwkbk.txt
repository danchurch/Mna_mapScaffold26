## okay, let's try to repeat our previous pipeline for finding the Pla1 region (and whatever else we want) from
## caroline's sequences. 

## first we need to even see if we have enough coverage to do this

## we'll try to use our notebook from another project:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/danchurch/MnaXlut_genome/blob/master/Hindcasting_Mna_genome.ipynb

## first task - get the sequences:

seqf="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sequences/"

cd $seqf

ssh dthomas01@stat.wm.edu
