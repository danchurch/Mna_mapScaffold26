## okay, let's try to repeat our previous pipeline for finding the Pla1 region (and whatever else we want) from
## caroline's sequences. 

## first we need to even see if we have enough coverage to do this

## we'll try to use our notebook from another project:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/danchurch/MnaXlut_genome/blob/master/Hindcasting_Mna_genome.ipynb

## first task - get the sequences:

seqf="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sequences/"
cd $seqf

ssh dthomas01@stat.wm.edu


## so we have the sequences. decompress them.

## now ecamine the quality. with Fastx?

## there's got to be something better out there, but let's move with what we got

## for the moment, we've got some old binaries for fastx at:

fastxF='/Users/danthomas/Desktop/fastxBin'

## do they work? they're old as hell

$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats"  -h

## seems ok...

$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats" -Q33 -i N_S24_L004_R1_001.fastq -o "N_S24_L004_R1_001-Stats.txt"
$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats" -Q33 -i N_S24_L004_R2_001.fastq -o "N_S24_L004_R2_001-Stats.txt"

## put these in the repo, they're small

qcF="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/qualityChecks"

cd $qcF

## okay, can we plot these now?
$fastxF/fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -i $qcF"/N_S24_L004_R1_001-Stats.txt" -o "N_S24_L004_R1_001_quality.eps" -p
$fastxF/fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -i $qcF"/N_S24_L004_R2_001-Stats.txt" -o "N_S24_L004_R2_001_quality.eps" -p

## ooh, there's some nastiness in there. Can we trim these?

## and I'm a little unclear if adapters were removed or not. 
## so let's install sickle and scythe, and run them through these

## first, since we know nothing about the history of these sequences, really,
## see if scythe picks up any adapters:

## oh, shoot, I don't know the adapters for this run. 

## let's move on, we can return to this if caroline comes through with that information

## if she doesn't have it, illumina has a catalogue of adapters here:
https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/experiment-design/illumina-adapter-sequences-1000000002694-11.pdf
## but man, that's a pain in the ass

## sickle

## use defaults - throw out reads less than 20bp, and qscores that bring average read qscore below 20:

sickle pe \
        -f $fwdSeqs \
        -r $revSeqs \
        -t sanger \

## actually, that location is going to fuck up my git repo, move them...



## we need a local copy of our reference genome and 
## to install bowtie

refGenFolder="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/"
curl -o $refGenFolder"Mimlut_unmasked_genome.fa" -k https://genomevolution.org/coge/api/v1/genomes/22585/sequence 

## install bowtie2

## we'll try the mac binaries. 

## add the bowtie2 binary folder to our path (this will go in our bash_profile file)

bowtie="/Users/danthomas/bowtie2"
export PATH=$PATH:$bowtie
sickle="/Users/danthomas/sickle"
export PATH=$PATH:$sickle
scythe="/Users/danthomas/scythe"
export PATH=$PATH:$scythe

## okay, let's see if we can index the reference genome with bowtie2:


mlugen="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/Mimlut_unmasked_genome.fa"

bowtie2-build -f $mlugen Mlu

## looks good.

############# bowtie alignment

## how can we align our trimmed files?,,,

samF="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/"
sickledFor="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/R1/qtrim.R1.fastq"
sickledRev="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/R2/qtrim.R2.fastq"
sickledUnp="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/unpaired/qtrim.unpaired.fastq"

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/bowtie_index

bowtie2 --local -x Mlu -1 $sickledFor -2 $sickledRev -U $sickledUnp -S $samF"MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam"

## hmm, we're going to need to move that sam folder, too. 

## okay, thats building the alignment. Let that chew over night...

## or longer, jesus. The sam is up to 33 gig, and growing...

## can we guess at our read depth?

grep "@" N_S24_L004_R1_001.fastq | wc -l

## 68924257 sequences
## 68,924,257 sequences
## plus reverse... so ~150,000,000 sequences, 

## thats good depth, lets see how much landed in our area of interest so far

## to get total number of reads:
grep "K00282:" /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam | wc -l

## 81,025,058 hm, seems like most sequences have at least been put on the sam somewhere...

head /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam 

## let's see how much landed in our area of interest so far

grep "scaffold_26" /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam | wc -l
## 802325 at this point in time. Seems decent...

########## sort clean alignment


## whenever that actually gets done, we'll need to sort it...
## so install samtools, maybe picard tools

## go bam

sam="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam"

samtools view $sam -b > MnaSeqs_MluRef.bam

## do we need?:
## samtools fixmate -m

## dunno. try it
samtools fixmate -O bam -m MnaSeqs_MluRef.bam MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated.bam

## sort
fixmate="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated.bam"

## and that failed. I'm restarting, but I will assume it is going to fail again. 
## How bad is the prospect of a cluster setup?

## we'll need to send the bam file to the cluster, and install samtools

## to upload to the cluster, we'll need to get it to my computer, go home, and sftp from the cluster to my computer
## mine 

## to see if it is worth it all, let's see if the cluster will install samtools locally.

## and I already have it on there... so transfer bam to my computer and then do this from home.


samtools sort $fixmate -o MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated_sorted.bam

## do we mark duplicates before or after we make an index?
## not sure... probably doesn't matter

## mark duplicates?

## nah, let's skip it. According to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4965708/ it's unnecessary
## and we are focusing on a really small region.

samtools index MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated_sorted.bam

## and now?

## check coverage?

## with bedtools:

bedtools genomecov -ibam MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated_sorted.bam -d > Mna_genome_cov_BP.txt 

## that's using a lot of resources, but let's let it run for a while. 

## while it's running, can we pull out just scaffold 26?

grep "scaffold_26"

## SN:lcl|scaffold_26      LN:830797

## I think we want 

## samtools view MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated_sorted.bam  "lcl|scaffold_26:50000-150000" > Mna_scaffold_26.sam

## actually, I think we need to tell it to keep the header with the -h flag:
samtools view -h MnaSeqs_MluRef_fixmated_sorted.bam  "lcl|scaffold_26:50000-150000" > Mna_scaffold_26.sam


## btw, notebook for the old genome pipeline is here, we sort of followed this:
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/danchurch/MnaXlut_genome/blob/master/Hindcasting_Mna_genome.ipynb

######## make a fasta of sequences from scaffold 26, for geneious #########

## we want just those 

samtools fastq Mna_scaffold_26.sam > MnaScaffold26.fastq
