## okay, let's try to repeat our previous pipeline for finding the Pla1 region (and whatever else we want) from
## caroline's sequences. 

## first we need to even see if we have enough coverage to do this

## we'll try to use our notebook from another project:

https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/danchurch/MnaXlut_genome/blob/master/Hindcasting_Mna_genome.ipynb

## first task - get the sequences:

seqf="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sequences/"
cd $seqf

ssh dthomas01@stat.wm.edu


## so we have the sequences. decompress them.

## now ecamine the quality. with Fastx?

## there's got to be something better out there, but let's move with what we got

## for the moment, we've got some old binaries for fastx at:

fastxF='/Users/danthomas/Desktop/fastxBin'

## do they work? they're old as hell

$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats"  -h

## seems ok...

$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats" -Q33 -i N_S24_L004_R1_001.fastq -o "N_S24_L004_R1_001-Stats.txt"
$fastxF"/fastx_quality_stats" -Q33 -i N_S24_L004_R2_001.fastq -o "N_S24_L004_R2_001-Stats.txt"

## put these in the repo, they're small

qcF="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/qualityChecks"

cd $qcF

## okay, can we plot these now?
$fastxF/fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -i $qcF"/N_S24_L004_R1_001-Stats.txt" -o "N_S24_L004_R1_001_quality.eps" -p
$fastxF/fastq_quality_boxplot_graph.sh -i $qcF"/N_S24_L004_R2_001-Stats.txt" -o "N_S24_L004_R2_001_quality.eps" -p

## ooh, there's some nastiness in there. Can we trim these?

## and I'm a little unclear if adapters were removed or not. 
## so let's install sickle and scythe, and run them through these

## first, since we know nothing about the history of these sequences, really,
## see if scythe picks up any adapters:

## oh, shoot, I don't know the adapters for this run. 

## let's move on, we can return to this if caroline comes through with that information

## if she doesn't have it, illumina has a catalogue of adapters here:
https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/experiment-design/illumina-adapter-sequences-1000000002694-11.pdf
## but man, that's a pain in the ass

## sickle

## actually, that location is going to fuck up my git repo, move them...



## we need a local copy of our reference genome and 
## to install bowtie

refGenFolder="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/"
curl -o $refGenFolder"Mimlut_unmasked_genome.fa" -k https://genomevolution.org/coge/api/v1/genomes/22585/sequence 

## install bowtie2

## we'll try the mac binaries. 

## add the bowtie2 binary folder to our path (this will go in our bash_profile file)

bowtie="/Users/danthomas/bowtie2"
export PATH=$PATH:$bowtie
sickle="/Users/danthomas/sickle"
export PATH=$PATH:$sickle
scythe="/Users/danthomas/scythe"
export PATH=$PATH:$scythe

## okay, let's see if we can index the reference genome with bowtie2:


mlugen="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/Mimlut_unmasked_genome.fa"

bowtie2-build -f $mlugen Mlu

## looks good.

############# bowtie alignment

## how can we align our trimmed files?,,,

samF="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/"
sickledFor="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/R1/qtrim.R1.fastq"
sickledRev="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/R2/qtrim.R2.fastq"
sickledUnp="/Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/sickleTrims/unpaired/qtrim.unpaired.fastq"

cd /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/mLutReferenceGenome/bowtie_index

bowtie2 --local -x Mlu -1 $sickledFor -2 $sickledRev -U $sickledUnp -S $samF"MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam"

## hmm, we're going to need to move that sam folder, too. 

## okay, thats building the alignment. Let that chew over night...

## or longer, jesus. The sam is up to 33 gig, and growing...

## can we guess at our read depth?

grep "@" N_S24_L004_R1_001.fastq | wc -l

## 68924257 sequences
## 68,924,257 sequences
## plus reverse... so ~150,000,000 sequences, 

## thats good depth, lets see how much landed in our area of interest so far

## to get total number of reads:
grep "K00282:" /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam | wc -l

## 81,025,058 hm, seems like most sequences have at least been put on the sam somewhere...

head /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam 

## let's see how much landed in our area of interest so far

grep "scaffold_26" /Users/danthomas/Documents/repeatedEvolution/naiandinus/Mna_mapScaffold26/SAM/MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam | wc -l
## 802325 at this point in time. Seems decent...


########## sort clean alignment


## whenever that actually gets done, we'll need to sort it...
## so install samtools, maybe picard tools

## go bam
samtools view MnaSeqs_MluRef.sam -b > MnaSeqs_MluRef.bam

## do we need?:
## samtools fixmate -m

## sort
samtools sort MnaSeqs_MluRef.bam -o MnaSeqs_MluRef_sorted.bam

## do we mark duplicates before or after we make an index?
## not sure...

## mark duplicates
samtools markdup

samtools index MnaSeqs_MluRef_sorted.bam


########## play with alignments

## just trying to remember clustal/muscle stuff

## sample mybs from genbank
muscle3 -in toyMybs.fa -fastaout toyMybs.afa -clwout toyMybs.aln -htmlout toyMybs.html
muscle -in seqs.fa -fastaout seqs.afa -clwout seqs.aln
